# lexing_1

Learning about interpreters and compilers? You should write a scanner / tokenizer, and parser!

This is my implementation of a scanner / tokenizer. I've been reading about recursive descent parsers, and I think thats probably better than my blpos implementation. 

The wiki page on recursive descent parsers shows a great example in C.

Next goals will be to create a rdp to replace the scanner/lexer I have here. I plan on integrating the language I'm designing (for CSV/SQL processing) into my csvt project.
